      <div class="row">
        <p> To fully comrehend the problem and get a better understanding of
          the marketplace, I ran a competitor analysis on key competitors- such as
          WebMD and MyChart. This would help me understand and identify product opportunities
          by observing what works vs what does not when it comes to handling health needs
          online.I performed S.W.O.T analysis and a UX analysis - which evaluated their usability,
          layout, navigation structure, compatibility, differentiation, and call to action.
          This helped me identify product opportunities for an app that integrates handling multiple health
          aspects in a quick & trustworthy way while encouraging users to pursue healthier habits.

        <div>
          <h2> Problem </h2>
          <p> Olive’s users need a safe, quick, & reliable way to manage personal medical tasks in a timely
            manner while being incentivized to follow healthier habits– such as engaging in physical activity,
            a healthy nutrition, better sleep, & being informed on overall mental wellbeing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2> Proposed Solution </h2>
          <p> We believe that by facilitating a way for users to manage real, medical tasks– as well as personalized,
            wellness features & informative facts– we will encourage users to prioritize their well-being.

        <h2> User Research </h2>
        <p> Before proceeding to create user flows and moockups, I wanted to get a better understanding & observation of
          our potential users. I conducted a few interviews with 3 goals in mind: </p>

          <img src="img/Olive/userResearchGoals.png" alt=" Case Study- Olive">
        </picture>
        <p> Prior to the interviews, I ran a short survey composed of 14 questions total, with 6 short free-response questions
          and the rest as MC. The goal was to obtain at least 10 responses. I obtained 14 in less than 3 days. I recruited two
          interviewees based on those responses. The other two interviewees were health-conscious colleagues. I recruited
          those who seemed genuinely interested in improving their health & had experienced tracking their health or
          booking appointments through websites and/or apps.</p>

          I mapped out user flows for the main functionalities of the app. This way,
          I would know what steps the user would take to get to their desired destination
          before laying out the information architecture. Based on my analysis and findings,
          I proposed the following sitemap...
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Sitemaps -->
      <div>
        <h2> Sitemaps </h2>
        <div>
          <h3> Proposed Sitemap </h3>
          <p> I created this sitemap with co-existing hierarchies so that users would have a
            general location in which to input their information as well as a page to find overall health-related information.
            I also isolated the medical and mindfulness tabs. The goal was for all sections to be easily accessible.</p>
          <p> However, after conducting open card sorting I validated some of my beliefs but invalidated others. I had to make
            refinements to the sitemap so as to accommodate user’s  mental models better.

      </div>
      <!-- Card Sorting -->
      <div>
        <p> To establish how the app’s pages would be laid out before creating mockups, I conducted open card sorting with
          real potential users. I recruited 5 participants interested in completing a digital, open card sort. They created
          a total of 24 categories with a median of 4 categories each. I used OptimalSort and used all of the 20 cards
          allowed with the free plan to include the basics of the content that would be included on the sitemap. Based on
          the results, I iterated on the sitemap to produce the following: </p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/Olive/Refined_Sitemap.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

        <h3> Refined Sitemap </h3>
        <div>
          <h2> Analysis </h2>
          <p>
             After going through the data, I realized that my categories could use different naming conventions. Many participants
            separated physical aspects of health from mental aspects – which I was content about– but used slightly different
            terminology that was more upfront in its own way. Rather than ‘health and fitness’  and ‘mindfulness,’ these became
            ‘body’ and ‘mind,’ highlighting the area of focus in the user’s health as they navigate through. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, although there were a total of 24 categories created, many of the categories were similar in their groupings – such as ‘profile’,
            ‘general’, and ‘tools’. I noticed a lot of variety and discrepancies with some of the cards that required input or interaction from the
            user (like sleep tracker, workout planner, meal planner). Therefore, I decided to create another section labeled ‘Plan’ in the sitemap
            in which users will ideally plan out most of their activities such as reminders, workouts, and chosen recipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the users categorized medical information and tools together. However, the majority included ‘records’ under the category of
            profile or general tools and account features. Therefore, I decided to include records and inbox under the user’s profile. This was
            also the case for “inbox” or notifications. Also, I realized that I could label “tracker” /“planner” as “Plan”  and integrate as
            a co-existing hierarchy for easy access.

          found– belonged to its corresponding participant. Then, I created the following affinity map to
          identify insights. </p>

            <li> My “Sleep Tracker” feature could probably be placed under the “mind” or mindfulness page as five of
              six users navigated to that page when listening to the task. </li>
            <li> The flow for booking a doctor’s appointment could use clarification. </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is necessary to improvise when asking users to navigate through your prototypes so

        <h2> Design Language </h2>
        <p> After implementing visual design principles and incorporating grid fundamentals, I finalized the design language so as to
          refine the user interface of the app and establish a better consistency, including button styles and icons.
          Below is my color palette: </p>

          </picture>
        </div>
        <p> I based my colors off what I wanted to invoke within our users. I wanted to promote an enthusiastic, light-hearted,
          and productive way of handling health-related tasks. For instance, since blue increases productivity and is related to
          the medical field, I used a light-hearted blue to highlight these tasks. And since lavender promotes relaxation,
          I decided to use it for the mindfulness/sleep page. </p>

          was more accessible. </p>

            <p> Here, I made sure the input fields had a greater contrast with the background color to improve
              visibility. I also added placeholders to clarify what type of information is being filled.</p>

            <p> The visibility of the estimated time to complete a workout or recipe was too dependent on its contrast against the images.
              For consistency and greater visibility, I decided to add a dark blue bar with white text on each content card. This way, users
              can easily spot the approximate time an activity will take. </p>

            <p> Initially, users would be able to view all their upcoming appointments once they began to scroll.
              However, this left doubt as to whether or not the functionality existed. For clarity, I decided to add a
              ‘view all’ button underneath.
              Additionally, I accentuated the top bar navigation by adding a line across the labels so that they are easily grouped
              and spotted by users.

        <p>Although I faced some challenges along the road– such as iterating on the IA, receiving conflicting feedback, and realizing

          Going through this process really shed a light on maintaining a user-centered approach when designing usable, intuitive platforms.
          Using the design thinking process, I was able to continuously grow and iterate as a designer. This helped me catch discrepancies
          in my designs and allowed me to use raw user data to create a product that would better benefit the intended users. I plan on iterating
          on my designs to refine accessibility and hope to conduct more user testing to better accommodate their needs.
