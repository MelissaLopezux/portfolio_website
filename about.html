              <h2> My Story </h2>
              <p> As an only child– when I didn’t visit my cousins– I would have fun by making art or creating outfits for my barbie dolls out of old clothing.
                I’ve always had a passion for creating and my undergrad experience at UC San Diego peaked my interest in experience design. After switching majors
                from Structural Engineering to Cognitive Science, I became passionate about interactive systems, cognitive theories, and the user experience. Specializing
                in design & interaction took me through challenging, fun projects that allowed me to hone my skills and develop an eye for detail & user needs. I developed
                a genuine interest in creating useful products that would make people smile and became skilled at generative & evaluative research, iterative wireframing
                & prototyping, information architecture, responsive design, emotional design, and design documentation. The projects I worked on gave me the opportunity to
                implement user-centered design and to evaluate competitors so as to identify product opportunities that satisfied multiple stakeholders.
                I have learned how to take user journeys from concept to thorough implementation and have developed the empathetic skills needed to discover user pain points.
                Thanks to my business minor, I have also learned to carry out product ideation & implementation from a business perspective. My goal is to have a positive impact
                on societies by creating intuitive, memorable experiences. I hope to implement design thinking and a user-centered approach to create innovative platforms that
                provide real solutions. I am eager to keep learning more so that I can further improve my abilities.
                Outside of work, I enjoy working out, drawing, spending time in nature, hanging out with loved ones, and dancing. I love trying new things and always look forward
                to learning more about life.
